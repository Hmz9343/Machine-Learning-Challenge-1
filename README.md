# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Adaptive learning is a method of education that makes use of computers to interactively presents teaching materials according to the ability or needs of the learner.

Problems-><br/>
A straight-forward approach is to present questions randomly in the quiz, but:
* Some questions may be more difficult than the others
* It may not be necessary for the learner to revisit questions that he can answer correctly with confidence
* The choices presented may affect the studentâ€™s confidence in answering the question

<br/>
A better way is to adapt the questions according to the current (estimated) ability of the learner
